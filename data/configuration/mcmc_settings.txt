# Configuration for calibrating the AgeSEPAIHRDModel.
# These settings are tuned for a complex, high-dimensional model
# requiring a long run for proper convergence and posterior exploration.
# For boolean flags, use 1.0 for true and 0.0 for false.

# --- Core MCMC Settings ---
# A long burn-in period is essential for the sampler to find the high-probability
# region of the posterior and for the adaptive step-size to stabilize.
burn_in 5000

# A large number of post-burn-in iterations are needed to generate a sufficient
# number of samples for accurate posterior analysis.
mcmc_iterations 20000

# Thinning reduces autocorrelation between saved samples and saves disk space.
# A value of 20 means we save 1 sample for every 20 generated (10,000 total samples).
thinning 20

# Report progress less frequently for long runs to avoid cluttering the log.
report_interval 100

# Calculating the posterior mean is a good practice to find a single best-fit set.
