# Hill Climbing Optimizer Settings
# Parallel Adaptive Hill Climbing with Cloud Search Strategy   
#
# This optimizer uses:
# 1. Cloud Generation: N candidate points using adaptive covariance
# 2. Parallel Evaluation: Distributes objective function calls across threads
# 3. Directional Line Search: Aggressive expansion/contraction along improvement direction
# 4. Covariance Adaptation: Updates search distribution based on successful steps
#
# Note: This optimizer does NOT store sample history (designed for MAP estimation)

# iterations: Total number of optimization iterations.
# Default: 2000
iterations 200

# report_interval: Frequency (in iterations) for logging progress updates.
# Default: 100
report_interval 100

# cloud_size_multiplier: Cloud size = num_threads * multiplier.
# Higher values generate more candidates per iteration for broader exploration.
# Default: 8
cloud_size_multiplier 5
