# NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler) Configuration File
# Single-phase calibration settings

# Total number of iterations (all samples are stored from iteration 1)
nuts_iterations 25

# Number of iterations for step-size adaptation (typically 10-25% of total)
nuts_adaptation_window 5

# Target acceptance probability (0.8-0.95 recommended for NUTS)
nuts_delta_target 0.8

# Maximum tree depth - REDUCED to limit computation time
# Each depth level doubles the number of leapfrog steps
# For expensive gradient evaluations, keep this low (2-4)
